# PhotonPong

Modern Pong built with Next.js, Phaser 3, and a serverless stack.

## Setup

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm prisma migrate dev
pnpm dev
```

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in secrets.

### Environment Variables

The app expects the following environment variables:

- `UPSTASH_REDIS_URL` – Upstash Redis REST URL
- `UPSTASH_REDIS_TOKEN` – Upstash Redis REST token

See `.env.example` for the complete list.

## Architecture Overview

  C --> E[(Upstash Redis)]
```

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Postgres database is reachable via `DATABASE_URL`.
- Run `pnpm prisma migrate dev` after changing the schema.
- If Playwright tests fail, install browsers with `npx playwright install`.
- Internationalization: currently only English is provided; add more locales under `src/locales/` as needed.
